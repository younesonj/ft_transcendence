## 🤔 What is ft_transcendence?

**ft_transcendence** is the **final and most ambitious Common-Core project** at [42 School](https://42.fr). It challenges students to build a **full-stack, production-grade web application** from scratch — featuring real-time features, authentication, microservices, and more.

We didn't just build *a* project. We built **RoomMate42** — a platform that solves a very real problem for every 42 student on the planet.

## 💡 The Problem We Solve

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaGhhcnVrOHkycHNvZnptYXdtazF2ZnVvMHZ2enJvZ3ZqNGlkYTA3MSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/jXS1fR2InDp9D7sbVE/giphy.gif" />
</p>

Every 42 student knows the struggle:

- 🏙️ You just got accepted to 42 — **congrats!** Now… where do you live?
- 📱 Scrolling through Facebook groups, Telegram chats, and random Discord servers at 2 AM looking for a room
- 😩 Finding a great apartment only to discover you'd be living with someone whose coding music playlist is *death metal on loop*
- 💸 Overpaying for a room because you had no time to search properly between your 42 projects

**RoomMate42** fixes all of this.

> 🎯 **Our platform allows authenticated 42 students (via their 42 Intra account) to find available homes for rent AND find their perfect roommate — all in one place, built by 42 students, for 42 students.**

No more scrolling. No more guessing. Just find your next roommate, ping them on our chat, and focus on what matters — **coding until 3 AM together** 🧑‍💻

</div>

**ibougajd** is the **DevOps Leader** and the architect behind the entire project infrastructure. While the rest of the team was writing code, ibougajd was building the fortress that keeps it all running.

**Responsibilities:**
- 🐳 **Docker & Docker Compose** — Containerized every single service; wrote the entire `docker-compose.yml` that orchestrates all microservices with health checks, restart policies, and dependency management
- 🛡️ **Nginx as Reverse Proxy + Load Balancer** — Configured Nginx with OWASP ModSecurity WAF as the single entry point to the application. All traffic is routed through Nginx which acts as a load balancer distributing requests across services and as a proxy server forwarding requests to the correct microservice
- 🔒 **SSL/TLS Security** — Set up automatic self-signed certificate generation via the `Makefile` so HTTPS works out of the box
- 📦 **Makefile Automation** — Created a clean `Makefile` so anyone can spin up the entire stack with a single `make all`
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL Setup** — Configured the database container with persistent volumes and automated initialization scripts
- 🌐 **Network Isolation** — Designed the Docker network topology so microservices communicate internally without exposing unnecessary ports
- 📊 **Monitoring & Logging Stack** — Prepared infrastructure for ELK stack, Prometheus, and Grafana (for when we have more sleep)

## 🛡️ Security Features

<div align="center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExanoxNTdodW1xNWJuZGt2aXVqamRxY2EwMG1pc2l3ZzFhazhjeGhlaCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/077i6AULCXc0FKTj9s/giphy.gif" width="300" alt="security gif"/>
</div>

- 🔒 **HTTPS Only** — All traffic is encrypted via SSL/TLS (self-signed for dev, production-ready for deployment)
- 🛡️ **OWASP ModSecurity WAF** — Nginx runs with the OWASP ModSecurity Web Application Firewall image to protect against common attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.)
- 🔑 **42 OAuth2** — No custom passwords — students authenticate exclusively via their official 42 Intra credentials
- 🪙 **JWT Tokens** — Stateless, short-lived tokens for secure API access
- 🌐 **Network Isolation** — All microservices communicate on an internal Docker network; only Nginx is exposed to the outside world
- 🚫 **Port Security** — No unnecessary ports exposed; all external requests go through the single Nginx gateway

## 😂 Behind the Scenes

<div align="center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13GIgrGdslD9oQ/giphy.gif" width="400" alt="funny coding gif"/>
</div>

Let's be honest. Building ft_transcendence was... an experience. 🙃

---

**A timeline of this project:**

| Week | What we planned | What actually happened |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | "We'll be done in 3 weeks" | We argued about the architecture for 5 days |
| Week 2 | "Let's start coding!" | ibougajd spent 4 days making Docker work on M1 Macs |
| Week 3 | "Backend is almost ready" | "Almost" |
| Week 4 | "Frontend looks great!" | Mohammed redesigned it 3 times |
| Week 5 | "Chat is done!" | Hamza discovered WebSockets |
| Week 6 | "AI is integrated!" | Ismail: "What's a neural network again?" |
| Week 7 | "Just polishing!" | 47 bug fixes, 3 all-nighters |
| Week 8 | "We're done!" | We were done ✅ |

---

**Some fun facts:**

- 🍕 Total pizzas consumed: **too many to count**
- ☕ Total coffees: **definitely above the healthy limit**
- 🐛 Bugs introduced by "just a quick fix": **all of them**
- 🕐 Times ibougajd said "it works on my machine": **0** *(because it works in Docker, not "your machine")*
- 📞 Times we called each other at midnight: **every single night during evaluation prep**
- 🤦 Times we forgot to `cp .env.example .env`: **embarrassingly many**

## 🏆 ft_transcendence — Our Last CC Project

<div align="center">

</div>

**ft_transcendence** is the **crown jewel of the 42 Common Core**. It's the project where everything you've learned — from C pointers to Docker networking — comes together in one glorious, over-engineered web application.

We are incredibly proud of what we built. Not just because it works (it does, we promise), but because:

- 🤝 We did it **together**, as a team, despite the distance, the timezone differences, and the occasional disagreement about tabs vs. spaces
- 🧠 We learned things we never imagined — microservices, WebSockets, OAuth, WAF, container orchestration, AI integration
- 💪 We pushed ourselves way beyond the subject requirements because we wanted to build something **real** and **useful**
- 🌍 We built something that could genuinely help **thousands of 42 students** around the world find a safe, comfortable place to live and the right people to live with

This project represents the end of the Common Core and the beginning of something bigger. We're not just 42 students anymore — we're engineers who can build full production systems from scratch.

**Thank you 42. It's been a ride. 🚀**
